
Garbage Collection:

Implicit Garbage Collection- it is automatically managed.

Used the free the memory as and when needed and its done automatically.

Generations:
Class Object created Managed Heap.
Gen 0--newly created objects

when gen0 go there one cycle of Garbage, ie they are saved and not garbage collected


Gen 1--are the objects that have survived through the cycle of GC, and now they are the safe objects on the managed heap.

Gen2--they are safest objects, and very very rarely they will be Garbage collected from here.



step1) objects on the heap
step2) LRU used objects are marked for GC
step3) marked object goes to the freachable queue
step4) GC.Collect()-- will be garbage collected
step5) compaction





Which objects survive Garbage Collections?

The objects which are most recently used objects from the heap they survive Garbage Collection.
Garbage Collection works on a algorithm called as LRU(Least Recently used) will be garbage collected
